            <h2>Plain English Programming</h2>

            <div>
                <p class="mt-4">Having programmed for many years in many languages, I often find myself thinking in English pseudo-code, then I translate my thoughts into whatever artificial syntax I’m working with at the time. So one day I thought, “Why not simply code at a natural language level and skip the translation step?” My elder son (also a programmer) and I talked it over, and we decided to test the theory. Specifically, we wanted to know:</p>
                <h3 class="">Progamming realted some question </h3>
                <h4> 1.    What is the difference between var , let and const in javascript ?</h4>
                <p class=""><span class="fw-bold">Ans:</span> var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not re-declared; const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared. They are all hoisted to the top of their scope. But while var variables are initialized with undefined , let and const variables are not initialized</p>

                <h4>2.  Whtat is the difference between arrow function and normal function??</h4>
                <P><span class="fw-bold">Ans:</span>Unlike regular functions, arrow functions do not have their own this . The value of this inside an arrow function remains the same throughout the lifecycle of the function and is always bound to the value of this in the closest non-arrow parent function.</P>

                <h4>3. Difference  between forEach,map, filter and find in javascript ??? </h4>

                <P> <span class="fw-bold">Ans:</span> Function <span class=" fw-bold">.forEach()</span> is another form of just a plain for loop that can be used to iterate through array items. This case of a function is used for more complex arrays, for example, an array of objects with a lot of entries than just an array of integers.
                    Function<span class=" fw-bold"> .map() </span> is a manipulative function that can modify each element’s content in an array that it is called on. This function returns a new array with modified values, the array that it is called on will stay still. This function is useful for adding a little change to an already existing array, for example adding a property to an object or modifying it. Its construction and use are identical to the previous function .forEach() and both can be used interchangeably.Function <span class=" fw-bold">.filter() </span> is a search function that returns all the elements that fulfil the assigned condition. You can search by simple terms, for example, that element is equal to a certain integer, or by more advanced terms, for example, searching for an object with certain property that is equal to something. Both examples have a very frequent use as a developer.Function <span class=" fw-bold"> .find() </span> is also a search function like the previous but they differ in one small detail — this function returns only one match in an array. If in an array is more than one result, the function will return the first that has matched.
                </P>

                <h4>4.  Why using template string in javascript???</h4>
                <p> <span class="fw-bold">Ans:</span>  Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us insert/interpolate variables and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate like in older versions of JavaScript. It allows us to create strings that are complex and contain dynamic elements.</p>
